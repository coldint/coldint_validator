# Introduction
Bittensor subnet 29 is focused on advancing collaborative, distributed model training and research, as well as sharing of innovative ideas regarding model structure, training and evaluation.
It started as a fork of subnet 9 (pretraining), which was somewhat static and lacked the incentive to publish small improvements.
See [Macrocosmos github](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/pretraining/releases/tag/v3.2.1) for the exact starting point.

The following documentation assumes you are familiar with basic Bittensor concepts: Miners, Validators, and incentives. If you need a primer, please check out https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks.

The initial competition rewards miners for improving model score on the [Fineweb-edu-2 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-score-2).

Miner rewards can also be earned by contributing code, bug-fixes or key suggestions or insights; see [coldint.io](https://coldint.io) for further detais.

See the [Miner](docs/miner.md) and [Validator](docs/validator.md) docs for more information about how they work, as well as setup instructions.

## Getting Started

This repo's main conversation is carried out in the Bittensor [Discord](https://discord.gg/bittensor). Visit the 'coldint' channel to ask questions and get real time feedback. You can view the ongoing running of the incentive mechanism, the best miners (see 'incentive'), the most in consensus validators (see 'vtrust') using this [taostats link](https://taostats.io/subnets/netuid-29/). The table shows all 256 participant UIDs with corresponding YC stats and earnings.

See [Miner Setup](docs/miner.md#getting-started) to learn how to set up a Miner.

See [Validator Setup](docs/validator.md#getting-started) to learn how to set up a Validator.
